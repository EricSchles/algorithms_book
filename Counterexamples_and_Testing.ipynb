    "# Counter Examples and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we learned how to prove or verify things.  In this section we'll learn about one of the technique for proving mathematical statements: proof by counter example.  This powerful technique honestly doesn't get enough love or attention in most mathematical theory books.  This is likely because it's not terribly interesting from a purely theoretical perspective.  To carry out a proof by counter example, you simply need to find _some_ example that your statement fails on.  This is because mathematical statements are _either_ true or false, but never both.  We saw this in the last section with respect to logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is likely 'uninteresting' about proof by counterexample comes from a question - how do you intelligently guess a bad example?  If we _could_ do that, then we'd probably know ahead of time that our theorem or lemma was correct or incorrect ahead of time, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it turns out, this is one of the great powers of computational systems.  We don't _need_ to guess intelligently when computers are involved, because we can guess thousands or millions or even _billions_ of times without doing very much work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will introduce a number of ideas which will aid us in finding counterexamples for conjectures regarding mathematical statements.  We will use Python in order to do this and a mental 'testing' framework.  Additionally, to ensure that our set up is not the reason that our tests pass, we will be running all of our tests in a tool called Docker.  In general, Docker will be useful throughout the book because of the content we will cover in the next section, however traditionally, it is taught along side testing, so we introduce it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will need an understanding of randomness in order to intelligently search for counter examples, so we'll see some rudiments of probability and statistics in this chapter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof By Counter Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we see how to do this in Python, let's look at some example proofs that make use of counterexamples.  As we stated above, proof by counterexample occurs when we come up with an example that disproves a conjecture.  Let's look at some example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f(x) = x^{4}$ is bijective such that $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disprove:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Here we say disprove, because we are **not** trying to prove the conjecture, but refute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $f(x) = x^{4}$ is a bijective function.  This implies that $\\forall$ x in the domain such that x $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ there is _one and only one_ y in the codomain, such that y $\\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter example:\n",
    "\n",
    "both (1, 1), (-1, 1) $\\in f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$1^{4}$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$-1^{4}$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $x^{4}$ is *not* bijective.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of this proof by counter example was to state the condition required for the statement to be true, and then show that a specific example fails to meet that condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function of the form $f(x) = x^{k}$ where k is even, in otherwords, k = 2 * l for some l $\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show a counter example here, we need to cover every function such that $f(x) = x^{k}$ where k is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and -a $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ as elements from the domain.   To get the corresponding elements in the codomain we simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(a) = a^{k} = a^{2l} = (a^{l})^{2}$$\n",
    "$$f(-a) = -a^{k} = -a^{2l} = (-a^{l})^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we need a specific fact - \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma: Any x $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x = y^{2}$ will be >= 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: y > 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "y > 0, therefore y * y > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: y < 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "y < 0, therefore we can do (-1) * y > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "((-1) * y) * ((-1) * y) > 0. (since we want to know the behavior of $y^{2}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "(-1) * (-1) * y * y > 0. (rearranging because mutliplication is associative)\n",
    "\n",
    "y * y > 0. (by -1 * -1 = 1 and 1 * a = a $\\forall$a)\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the original proof.  Now we know $x^{2}$ > 0.  So we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (a^{l})^{2} = (-a^{l})^{2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the only difference between the left and right hand side of the equation is the `-` symbol.  Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "(a, $a^{k}$), (-a, $a^{k}$) $\\in f(x)= x^{k}$, $\\forall k$ such that k is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have found _infinite_ counter examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how to prove things by counterexample, let's move onto how Python can aid us in looking for counterexamples through automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we looked at how to come up with counterexamples to falisfy conjectures.  Now we'll learn how to extend that to code.  The ideas are essentially analogous, so let's jump right into an example.\n",
    "\n",
