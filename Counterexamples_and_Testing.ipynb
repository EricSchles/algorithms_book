    "# Counter Examples and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we learned how to prove or verify things.  In this section we'll learn about one of the technique for proving mathematical statements: proof by counter example.  This powerful technique honestly doesn't get enough love or attention in most mathematical theory books.  This is likely because it's not terribly interesting from a purely theoretical perspective.  To carry out a proof by counter example, you simply need to find _some_ example that your statement fails on.  This is because mathematical statements are _either_ true or false, but never both.  We saw this in the last section with respect to logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is likely 'uninteresting' about proof by counterexample comes from a question - how do you intelligently guess a bad example?  If we _could_ do that, then we'd probably know ahead of time that our theorem or lemma was correct or incorrect ahead of time, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it turns out, this is one of the great powers of computational systems.  We don't _need_ to guess intelligently when computers are involved, because we can guess thousands or millions or even _billions_ of times without doing very much work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will introduce a number of ideas which will aid us in finding counterexamples for conjectures regarding mathematical statements.  We will use Python in order to do this and a mental 'testing' framework.  Additionally, to ensure that our set up is not the reason that our tests pass, we will be running all of our tests in a tool called Docker.  In general, Docker will be useful throughout the book because of the content we will cover in the next section, however traditionally, it is taught along side testing, so we introduce it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will need an understanding of randomness in order to intelligently search for counter examples, so we'll see some rudiments of probability and statistics in this chapter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof By Counter Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we see how to do this in Python, let's look at some example proofs that make use of counterexamples.  As we stated above, proof by counterexample occurs when we come up with an example that disproves a conjecture.  Let's look at some example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f(x) = x^{4}$ is bijective such that $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disprove:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Here we say disprove, because we are **not** trying to prove the conjecture, but refute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $f(x) = x^{4}$ is a bijective function.  This implies that $\\forall$ x in the domain such that x $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ there is _one and only one_ y in the codomain, such that y $\\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter example:\n",
    "\n",
    "both (1, 1), (-1, 1) $\\in f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$1^{4}$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$-1^{4}$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $x^{4}$ is *not* bijective.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of this proof by counter example was to state the condition required for the statement to be true, and then show that a specific example fails to meet that condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function of the form $f(x) = x^{k}$ where k is even, in otherwords, k = 2 * l for some l $\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show a counter example here, we need to cover every function such that $f(x) = x^{k}$ where k is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and -a $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ as elements from the domain.   To get the corresponding elements in the codomain we simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(a) = a^{k} = a^{2l} = (a^{l})^{2}$$\n",
    "$$f(-a) = -a^{k} = -a^{2l} = (-a^{l})^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we need a specific fact - \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma: Any x $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x = y^{2}$ will be >= 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: y > 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "y > 0, therefore y * y > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: y < 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "y < 0, therefore we can do (-1) * y > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "((-1) * y) * ((-1) * y) > 0. (since we want to know the behavior of $y^{2}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "(-1) * (-1) * y * y > 0. (rearranging because mutliplication is associative)\n",
    "\n",
    "y * y > 0. (by -1 * -1 = 1 and 1 * a = a $\\forall$a)\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the original proof.  Now we know $x^{2}$ > 0.  So we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (a^{l})^{2} = (-a^{l})^{2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the only difference between the left and right hand side of the equation is the `-` symbol.  Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "(a, $a^{k}$), (-a, $a^{k}$) $\\in f(x)= x^{k}$, $\\forall k$ such that k is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have found _infinite_ counter examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how to prove things by counterexample, let's move onto how Python can aid us in looking for counterexamples through automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we looked at how to come up with counterexamples to falisfy conjectures.  Now we'll learn how to extend that to code.  The ideas are essentially analogous, so let's jump right into an example.\n",

This might be because of the operating system, the version of programming language, in our case Python, or because of the hardware.  There isn't much we can do to assess hardware related performance checks, unless you happen to have a bunch of computers lying around.  But we _can_ check for differences in performance due to the operating system and the version of Python.  For this we are going to need to _simulate_ the operating system and version of Python.  Mostly because installing a bunch of different operating systems and Python versions on one physical computer is a giant pain.\n",

    "Now that you have docker installed, please go ahead and register for [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have docker installed, let's talk about exactly how it works and what it is.  Docker is a \"runtime\" environment for \"containers\".  A container is like an operating system, except very tiny and only with the specific pieces you want.  You can have a container that does _everything_ a regular operating system does, but typically you only want or need certain parts of the operating system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about _what_ docker is (a little), let's talk about why you would use it.  Docker allows you to package up an environment along with an application, and ensure that the application will always run, regardless of what machine it's on.  If you've ever tried to get someone else's application running from source, then you will understand just how powerful this is.  Before containers and Docker (which are two seperate things), it was _very_ hard for software engineers to package up their code into applications.  And many 'applications' you'd find on github and other open source systems would be _very_ hard to get running.  With containers, you can just pull down the environment that the original developers used, and run the code (assuming the container was created correctly).  More or less, in developer speak, containers let you \"ship your machine\" along with the code.  So you don't have to worry as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why will we be using Docker?  This is getting a little ahead of things, but it's worth it to understand the motivation.  We are learning Docker/containers because not all operating systems will run the same code the same way.  And by using this technology we can ensure that we have enough statistically diverse environments to ensure we get an accurate measure of the algorithmic performance of our code.  If this motivation went over your head, don't worry too much.  We'll be introducing the analysis of algorithms soon.  And hopefully then it will make much more sense.\n",
    "\n",

    "Terraform is a tool for deploying a service to some \"infrastructure\" this typically means the cloud, but in our case, it means to docker.  Using terraform it will be easy to download a given piece of code, run the code, get the necessary data from the code, and do the homeworks.  At first this make seem daunting, having to learn so many new technologies all in a row, but it will be to your benefit, as these tools are _also_ industry standard for computer scientists.\n",

    "## Sequential Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "If your algorithm is the first of it's kind to do a specific thing, then testing specific values is the best you can hope for.  That said, many algorithms actually do _the same thing_ just in different ways.  In this sense, we can think of an algorithm like a mathematical relation, except instead of one rule that gives us the mathematical rule on the relation, we can have _several_ primitives build up to a rule in different ways.  This difference in how primitives are used to build towards mathematical rules is what allows algorithms to vary in performance in terms of speed.  For algorithms, it is not enough to be correct, it is also about getting to the right answer quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, correctness cannot always be guaranteed with an algorithm in absolute terms, the way it can be for a mathematical function.  This is due to the limited capacity of memory in computers - there is a finite amount of numbers a computer can accurately express, even when it comes to the integers.  This is even worse for the floating point numbers since even very small numbers, in terms of magnitude, can have many significant digits.  So, typically when we think of correctness for algorithms, we think about this in terms of some _large_ set of computables, but not _every_ number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above notion of correctness, as well as the ability to choose from a variety of \"correct\" algorithms, it is often advantageous to choose a given correct, however possibly inefficient algorithm and use that as a sanity check for a range of values for a new and possibly more efficient algorithm.\n",

Any even number will have a `0` in the position furthest to the right, while any odd number will have a `1` there.  That's because $2^{0}=1$.  In general the formula for a binary number is:\n",

If it is, then the $membership$ function returns 1, if it's not then the $membership$ function returns 0.  Then all the $membership$ function values are recorded, which is what gives us the binary number. \n",

    "Probability is the study of uncertainty.  Using probability we can answer questions about how likely an event is to occur.  To begin our analysis of probability we will first look at a very important function - the counting function.  This function will allow us to _count the number of elements of a set_.  Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose A = {1,2,3}, then $|A| = 3$, here $|A|$ is the count of the set A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some important trivial cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A = $\\emptyset$, then $|A| = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If A = $\\mathbb{N}$, then $|A| = \\infty$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at how the counting function works with respect to our set operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A, B are sets, such that $A \\neq \\emptyset$, $B \\neq \\emptyset$, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|(A\\text{ } \\cup \\text{ } B)| = |A| + |B|, such \\text{ } that A \\cap B = \\emptyset$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally speaking, there exists a theorem called the partition principal that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A_{1}, A_{2}, .. A_{n}$ are all non-empty non-overlapping subsets of a set C, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |C| = |A_{1}| + |A_{2}| + ... + |A_{n}| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because $A_{i}, A_{j}$ non-overlapping, $A_{i} \\cap A_{j} = \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a corollary, notice that if we have a set A, such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $A \\neq \\emptyset$ then $A, \\bar{A}$ form a natural partition of $C$.  Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|C| = |A| + |\\bar{A}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|C| - |A| = |\\bar{A}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other identities that are presented without proof include:\n",

    "$$|A| = |(A \\cap B)| + |(A \\cap \\bar{B})|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|A| - |(A \\cap B)| = |(A \\cap \\bar{B})|$$\n",

    "The first concept we will need is that of the sample space:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition - \n",
    "\n",
    "A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of random phenomena include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* tossing a coin\n",
    "* rolling a dice\n",
    "* choosing a card from a deck\n",
    "\n",
    "One common theme for all of these examples, we cannot predict with certainty what will happen next, that is, we cannot treat these phenomena like the inputs and outputs of a function, or an algorithm.  But we can assess write down all the things that _might_ happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the toss of a coin there are two possible results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heads\n",
    "* Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore our sample space for a single flip is just the set {H, T} (H for heads, T for tails).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the rolling of a dice the sample space is the numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for the choosing of a card, we have 52 possabilities in a standard french deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, it is possible to write down _all_ of the possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to begin defining probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let S be a sample space and let E be an event, a specific element from element or 'occurrence' from the sample space, then the probability of an event E in S be P(E).  Probabilities of events in a sample space will always be required to obey the following axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom 1.  The probability of an event is always a non-negative number, therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(E) \\ge 0 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Axiom 2. If the sample space is S, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(S) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom 3.  If $A_{1}, A_{2}, .. A_{n}$ are all non-empty non-overlapping subsets of a set S, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(S) = P(A_{1}) + P(A_{2}) + ... + P(A_{n}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because $A_{i}, A_{j}$ non-overlapping, $A_{i} \\cap A_{j} = \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "If axiom 3 looks familiar, that's because it should!  It's the same as the identity we learned about earlier, except, instead of a counting function $|*|$, we replaced it with $P()$, the probability function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a notion of a probability function, we can define how to calculate the probability _from_ the counting function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $E$ be an event in a sample space $S$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to apply our new formula to the above three examples.  Let's begin with a coin flip -\n",

    "What is the probability of getting heads?\n",
