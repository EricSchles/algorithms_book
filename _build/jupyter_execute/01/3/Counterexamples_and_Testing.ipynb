    "# Counter Examples and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we learned how to prove or verify things.  In this section we'll learn about one of the technique for proving mathematical statements: proof by counter example.  This powerful technique honestly doesn't get enough love or attention in most mathematical theory books.  This is likely because it's not terribly interesting from a purely theoretical perspective.  To carry out a proof by counter example, you simply need to find _some_ example that your statement fails on.  This is because mathematical statements are _either_ true or false, but never both.  We saw this in the last section with respect to logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is likely 'uninteresting' about proof by counterexample comes from a question - how do you intelligently guess a bad example?  If we _could_ do that, then we'd probably know ahead of time that our theorem or lemma was correct or incorrect ahead of time, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it turns out, this is one of the great powers of computational systems.  We don't _need_ to guess intelligently when computers are involved, because we can guess thousands or millions or even _billions_ of times without doing very much work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will introduce a number of ideas which will aid us in finding counterexamples for conjectures regarding mathematical statements.  We will use Python in order to do this and a mental 'testing' framework.  Additionally, to ensure that our set up is not the reason that our tests pass, we will be running all of our tests in a tool called Docker.  In general, Docker will be useful throughout the book because of the content we will cover in the next section, however traditionally, it is taught along side testing, so we introduce it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will need an understanding of randomness in order to intelligently search for counter examples, so we'll see some rudiments of probability and statistics in this chapter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof By Counter Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we see how to do this in Python, let's look at some example proofs that make use of counterexamples.  As we stated above, proof by counterexample occurs when we come up with an example that disproves a conjecture.  Let's look at some example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f(x) = x^{4}$ is bijective such that $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disprove:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Here we say disprove, because we are **not** trying to prove the conjecture, but refute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $f(x) = x^{4}$ is a bijective function.  This implies that $\\forall$ x in the domain such that x $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ there is _one and only one_ y in the codomain, such that y $\\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter example:\n",
    "\n",
    "both (1, 1), (-1, 1) $\\in f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$1^{4}$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$-1^{4}$ = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $x^{4}$ is *not* bijective.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of this proof by counter example was to state the condition required for the statement to be true, and then show that a specific example fails to meet that condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function of the form $f(x) = x^{k}$ where k is even, in otherwords, k = 2 * l for some l $\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show a counter example here, we need to cover every function such that $f(x) = x^{k}$ where k is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and -a $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ as elements from the domain.   To get the corresponding elements in the codomain we simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(a) = a^{k} = a^{2l} = (a^{l})^{2}$$\n",
    "$$f(-a) = -a^{k} = -a^{2l} = (-a^{l})^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we need a specific fact - \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma: Any x $\\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x = y^{2}$ will be >= 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: y > 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "y > 0, therefore y * y > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: y < 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "y < 0, therefore we can do (-1) * y > 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "((-1) * y) * ((-1) * y) > 0. (since we want to know the behavior of $y^{2}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "(-1) * (-1) * y * y > 0. (rearranging because mutliplication is associative)\n",
    "\n",
    "y * y > 0. (by -1 * -1 = 1 and 1 * a = a $\\forall$a)\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the original proof.  Now we know $x^{2}$ > 0.  So we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (a^{l})^{2} = (-a^{l})^{2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the only difference between the left and right hand side of the equation is the `-` symbol.  Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "(a, $a^{k}$), (-a, $a^{k}$) $\\in f(x)= x^{k}$, $\\forall k$ such that k is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have found _infinite_ counter examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand how to prove things by counterexample, let's move onto how Python can aid us in looking for counterexamples through automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we looked at how to come up with counterexamples to falisfy conjectures.  Now we'll learn how to extend that to code.  The ideas are essentially analogous, so let's jump right into an example.\n",

This might be because of the operating system, the version of programming language, in our case Python, or because of the hardware.  There isn't much we can do to assess hardware related performance checks, unless you happen to have a bunch of computers lying around.  But we _can_ check for differences in performance due to the operating system and the version of Python.  For this we are going to need to _simulate_ the operating system and version of Python.  Mostly because installing a bunch of different operating systems and Python versions on one physical computer is a giant pain.\n",

    "Now that you have docker installed, please go ahead and register for [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have docker installed, let's talk about exactly how it works and what it is.  Docker is a \"runtime\" environment for \"containers\".  A container is like an operating system, except very tiny and only with the specific pieces you want.  You can have a container that does _everything_ a regular operating system does, but typically you only want or need certain parts of the operating system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about _what_ docker is (a little), let's talk about why you would use it.  Docker allows you to package up an environment along with an application, and ensure that the application will always run, regardless of what machine it's on.  If you've ever tried to get someone else's application running from source, then you will understand just how powerful this is.  Before containers and Docker (which are two seperate things), it was _very_ hard for software engineers to package up their code into applications.  And many 'applications' you'd find on github and other open source systems would be _very_ hard to get running.  With containers, you can just pull down the environment that the original developers used, and run the code (assuming the container was created correctly).  More or less, in developer speak, containers let you \"ship your machine\" along with the code.  So you don't have to worry as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why will we be using Docker?  This is getting a little ahead of things, but it's worth it to understand the motivation.  We are learning Docker/containers because not all operating systems will run the same code the same way.  And by using this technology we can ensure that we have enough statistically diverse environments to ensure we get an accurate measure of the algorithmic performance of our code.  If this motivation went over your head, don't worry too much.  We'll be introducing the analysis of algorithms soon.  And hopefully then it will make much more sense.\n",
    "\n",

    "Terraform is a tool for deploying a service to some \"infrastructure\" this typically means the cloud, but in our case, it means to docker.  Using terraform it will be easy to download a given piece of code, run the code, get the necessary data from the code, and do the homeworks.  At first this make seem daunting, having to learn so many new technologies all in a row, but it will be to your benefit, as these tools are _also_ industry standard for computer scientists.\n",

    "## Sequential Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "If your algorithm is the first of it's kind to do a specific thing, then testing specific values is the best you can hope for.  That said, many algorithms actually do _the same thing_ just in different ways.  In this sense, we can think of an algorithm like a mathematical relation, except instead of one rule that gives us the mathematical rule on the relation, we can have _several_ primitives build up to a rule in different ways.  This difference in how primitives are used to build towards mathematical rules is what allows algorithms to vary in performance in terms of speed.  For algorithms, it is not enough to be correct, it is also about getting to the right answer quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, correctness cannot always be guaranteed with an algorithm in absolute terms, the way it can be for a mathematical function.  This is due to the limited capacity of memory in computers - there is a finite amount of numbers a computer can accurately express, even when it comes to the integers.  This is even worse for the floating point numbers since even very small numbers, in terms of magnitude, can have many significant digits.  So, typically when we think of correctness for algorithms, we think about this in terms of some _large_ set of computables, but not _every_ number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above notion of correctness, as well as the ability to choose from a variety of \"correct\" algorithms, it is often advantageous to choose a given correct, however possibly inefficient algorithm and use that as a sanity check for a range of values for a new and possibly more efficient algorithm.\n",

Any even number will have a `0` in the position furthest to the right, while any odd number will have a `1` there.  That's because $2^{0}=1$.  In general the formula for a binary number is:\n",

If it is, then the $membership$ function returns 1, if it's not then the $membership$ function returns 0.  Then all the $membership$ function values are recorded, which is what gives us the binary number. \n",

    "Probability is the study of uncertainty.  Using probability we can answer questions about how likely an event is to occur.  To begin our analysis of probability we will first look at a very important function - the counting function.  This function will allow us to _count the number of elements of a set_.  Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose A = {1,2,3}, then $|A| = 3$, here $|A|$ is the count of the set A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some important trivial cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A = $\\emptyset$, then $|A| = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If A = $\\mathbb{N}$, then $|A| = \\infty$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at how the counting function works with respect to our set operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A, B are sets, such that $A \\neq \\emptyset$, $B \\neq \\emptyset$, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|(A\\text{ } \\cup \\text{ } B)| = |A| + |B|, such \\text{ } that A \\cap B = \\emptyset$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally speaking, there exists a theorem called the partition principal that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A_{1}, A_{2}, .. A_{n}$ are all non-empty non-overlapping subsets of a set C, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |C| = |A_{1}| + |A_{2}| + ... + |A_{n}| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because $A_{i}, A_{j}$ non-overlapping, $A_{i} \\cap A_{j} = \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a corollary, notice that if we have a set A, such that $A \\subseteq C$ and $A \\neq \\emptyset$ then $A, \\bar{A}$ form a natural partition of $C$.  Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|C| = |A| + |\\bar{A}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|C| - |A| = |\\bar{A}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other identities that are presented without proof include:\n",

    "$$|A| = |(A \\cap B)| + |(A \\cap \\bar{B})|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|A| - |(A \\cap B)| = |(A \\cap \\bar{B})|$$\n",

    "The first concept we will need is that of the sample space:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition - \n",
    "\n",
    "A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of random phenomena include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* tossing a coin\n",
    "* rolling a dice\n",
    "* choosing a card from a deck\n",
    "\n",
    "One common theme for all of these examples, we cannot predict with certainty what will happen next, that is, we cannot treat these phenomena like the inputs and outputs of a function, or an algorithm.  But we can assess write down all the things that _might_ happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the toss of a coin there are two possible results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heads\n",
    "* Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore our sample space for a single flip is just the set {H, T} (H for heads, T for tails).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the rolling of a dice the sample space is the numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for the choosing of a card, we have 52 possabilities in a standard french deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, it is possible to write down _all_ of the possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to begin defining probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let S be a sample space and let E be an event, a specific element from element or 'occurrence' from the sample space, then the probability of an event E in S be P(E).  Probabilities of events in a sample space will always be required to obey the following axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom 1.  The probability of an event is always a non-negative number, therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(E) \\ge 0 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Axiom 2. If the sample space is S, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(S) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom 3.  If $A_{1}, A_{2}, .. A_{n}$ are all non-empty non-overlapping subsets of a set S, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(S) = P(A_{1}) + P(A_{2}) + ... + P(A_{n}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because $A_{i}, A_{j}$ non-overlapping, $A_{i} \\cap A_{j} = \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "If axiom 3 looks familiar, that's because it should!  It's the same as the identity we learned about earlier, except, instead of a counting function $|*|$, we replaced it with $P()$, the probability function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a notion of a probability function, we can define how to calculate the probability _from_ the counting function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $E$ be an event in a sample space $S$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how to apply our new formula to the above three examples.  Let's begin with a coin flip -\n",

    "What is the probability of getting heads?\n",

    "Now that we've seen how to easily calculate the sample space for a permutation, or sampling without replacement, what if we were allowed to replace our elements?  Then we'd be in the above case dealing with cartesian products, and our sample space would be\n",

    "\n",
    "The final formula we will look at in this section to get a sample space is to look at combinations.  Combinations are particularly useful when dealing with defining probabilities with things like cards.  For instance, what's the probability of selecting a red jack?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we can use combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination \"selects\" or \"chooses\" a property within a set of properties.  In other words, if we have a bunch of things and we have different attributes associated with different subsets of the things, we can count how many ways we can get that attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's describe the formula for combination: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {n \\choose r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, ${n \\choose r}$ is read, \"n choose r\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's calculate our probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${52 \\choose 1} = \\frac{52!}{1! * 51!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because there are 52 cards in the deck and we are selecting one of them.  So our denominator is 52.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for our numerator:\n",
    "\n",
    "We first choose the color:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${ 2 \\choose 1} = \\frac{2!}{1! * 1!} = 2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we choose a jack, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${ 1 \\choose 1} = \\frac{1!}{1! * 0!} = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this final \"choice\" is ${1 \\choose 1}$ is because there is only _one_ way to choose a jack from amongst the 13 choices of card numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $\\frac{2 * 1}{52} = \\frac{2}{52}$ for our probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a more interesting card example.  Next, let's calculate how many ways we can get an _even_ card selected from a standard deck.  Note, for this example, we won't need an denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first must choose a color, which will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${ 4 \\choose 1} = \\frac{4!}{1! * 1!} = 4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we select an even:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${13 \\choose 5} = \\frac{13!}{5! * 8!} = \\frac{13*12*11*10*9}{5*4*3*2} = 13*11*9$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Using one of these three formulas, depending on the type of selection we are doing, we can \"count\" the number of events of interest and the sample space with relative ease.  Thus we can calculate many classes of probabilities in a straight forward manor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, what happens when we want to know the probability of an event that _depends_ on another event?  For instance, what is the probability it will rain, is very different than asking, what is the probability it will rain given that the dew point is 38 degrees?\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are saying from the above is that the event it will rain is related, or _conditional_ on the dew point.  And that whether or not the dew point is 38 degrees will change the chance it will rain.  In general, this sort of computation is called calculating the conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following formula is generally used to do such a calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for discrete cases, the intersection $A \\cap B$ is just:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{|(A \\cap B)|}{|S|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where is is the total sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P(B)$ also depends on $|S|$, we can actually look at a simplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{|(A \\cap B)|}{|S|}}{\\frac{|B|}{|S|}} = \\frac{|(A \\cap B)|}{|B|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So when calculating the conditional probability, we don't need to consider the the sample space at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you are playing a guessing game, where you and an opponent must take turns guessing cards.  Specifically, your opponent draws a card and then tells you something about the card.  From there you need to deduce a second property about the card.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume your opponent tells you the card is a club, from there you want to state the characteristic that is most likely, that you cannot automatically deduce.  Here are some properties, with their calculated probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That the card is even:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we need to notice that 2,4,6,8,10 are the even numbers.  Since we know that it's a club we may be tempted to say that the probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{5}{13} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Chance of it being even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if our formula yields the same answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by calculating the individual proabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(A) - card is even - $\\frac{20}{52}$\n",
    "* P(B) - card is club - $\\frac{13}{52}$\n",
    "* P($A \\cap B$) - card is even and a club -  $\\frac{5}{13}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{13}}{\\frac{13}{52}} = \\frac{5}{52} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So in fact our conditional probability was different!  How is conditional different than intersection?  With intersection we are assuming our events happen in sequence.  So by having information ahead of time, we are able to say something different.  Essentially what we are talking about here is a _dependence structure_.  When events are _related_ or their intersection is non-zero, then the available information matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next let's consider the probability of the card being a face card, given that it is clubs:\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by calculating the individual proabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(A) - card is a face - $\\frac{12}{52}$\n",
    "* P(B) - card is club - $\\frac{13}{52}$\n",
    "* P($A \\cap B$) - card is face and a club -  $\\frac{3}{13}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{13}}{\\frac{13}{52}} = \\frac{3}{52} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result should be unsurprising, since there are more even cards than face cards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's look at calculating the probability for a card being a 6 given that it is a club:\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by calculating the individual proabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(A) - card is 6 - $\\frac{4}{52}$\n",
    "* P(B) - card is club - $\\frac{13}{52}$\n",
    "* P($A \\cap B$) - card is a 6 and a club -  $\\frac{1}{13}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{13}}{\\frac{13}{52}} = \\frac{1}{52} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This last one _should_ line up with your intuition in a clear enough way, because there is exactly 1 6 of clubs in a standard french deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how probabilities are calculated when there is a clear _dependence relationship_ between events, what happens if the opposite is true, that is what if events are _independent_?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the $P(A|B) = P(A)$ because $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$, therefore $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)*P(B)}{P(B)}$.  For events to be independent, is the same thing as the events _not being related_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now in a place to talk about our first _distribution_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple scenario - you wish you know the probability of getting heads or tails for a coin flip.  We can calculate that easy enough -\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} = P(T) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, there is a 50% chance of getting heads and a 50% chance of getting tails.  But does that mean every flip of a coin where we get heads is followed by tails?  Certainly not!  The probability is sort of like a short hand or the _asymptotic_ behavior of an event with _predictable_ outcomes.  A predictable system is one in which we don't know any given occurrence for the next experimental trial, but in general, we can figure out how the trial will behave over a large enough iterations.  In other words, there is choas or uncertainty in _any_ given coin flip, but there is consistency in the pattern as we tail up more and more coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have a computer, we don't need to actually do the coin flips ourselves.  Let's create an experiment where we flip coins until we get the ideal probability, or at least verify that this is truly what will happen:"

    "Which agrees with our theoretical asymptotic behavior.  The reason the numbers don't act how you expect anymore is because we are being _precise_.  We aren't asking for approximately 500 head flips in 1000 trials, we are asking for _exactly_ 500 head flips in 1000 trials.  Since we are using a combination, we don't care about the _order_ of those 500 heads, but there must be _exactly_ 500.  This is why our probabilities get so small as our number of trials increase.  You can think of each trial as segmenting the sample space a little bit more.  For instance, let's suppose we started with small numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we wanted the probability of 3 heads from 5 trials, what does that sample space look like now?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's a lot to write, we'll just look at one 'row':\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sample Space = {\n",
    "    (H,H,H,H,H), (T,H,H,H,H), (T,T,H,H,H), (T,T,T,H,H), (T,T,T,T,H), (T,T,T,T,T)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In total our sample space contains $5^{2} = 25$ possible cases.  Recall that a single trial only has a sample space of 2 - so with only an increase of 4 trials, we've increased our sample space 12 fold.  That's alot!  As our number of trials increases, the size of our sample space increases _exponentially_.  That's why the probabilities get so small in our formula as the number of trials increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one last feature that's embedded in this formula - all of the trials are _independent_ that's why we can take _combinations_.  If there was a dependence structure then formula wouldn't apply.  This means, we can apply this formula to _any_ trials where the probability of the outcomes for a given event are known, and the trials are independent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can think of this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {n \\choose k} p^{k} * q^{n - k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a _model_ for any trials with two indepedent cases with known individual probabilities.  This model allows us to characterize more than the individual probabilities for a given event, by iterating over n and k, we can see the forest, we can see the 'shape' of the probability over the entire event space as the number of trials increases:"

    "It's even worse if our probabilities are lopsided!  Anywho, there are lots of fun things you can do with distributions - if your distribution is a good model of the underlying thing, then you can use the distribution to run experiments on your computer, and you can learn about the real world!  Pretty neat, right?!\n",

    "The first two distributions are _continuous_ distributions, meaning they are modeled using real valued functions, and that they are good for modeling things can't be easily broken up into discrete events.  Typically with continuous random variables you talk about the probability of something happening below or above a threshold, or between two thresholds or outside two thresholds.  So for instance, suppose X was a continuous random variable then we might ask:\n",

    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\sigma$ stands for the spread of the distribution, which in the case of the normal distribution is the variance.\n",

    "Here x is just a parameter to the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else is just a constant.  \n",

    "The $\\mu$ on the other hand, has a more interesting meaning, specifically it is the expected number of occurrences of the event over a given period.  Typically poisson random variables are used to measure events per time unit, like per minute or per hour or per year.  So if we expect 5 occurrences per hour, for instance, we can tell how many events are likely to occur - the above graph shows the likelihood of the number of events of interest occurring over a typical hour.  Notice that at 5 we have the densed count - because we _expect_ 5 events.  However, that doesn't mean that 4, or 6 events couldn't occur within the next hour.  However it is unlikely that 9 or 10 events.  \n",

    "The way we create random or psuedo random numbers is fascinating, but honestly is _a lot to explain_ and this introductory chapter is already getting _very long_.  For those of you interested in how to generate numbers that don't follow a distribution please check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&t=549s&ab_channel=Veritasium - in general Veritasium is a great channel and highly recommended by the author."
