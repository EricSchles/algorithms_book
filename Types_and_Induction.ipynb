    "Each of the above functions drives towards a point - all the 'primitive' types in programming actually have a bijection to the binary numbers.  Therefore in a sense, the types we've seen so far implemented in a programming language actually comprise just one type, the computables.  The way the computables are used indicates we are attempting an _approximation_ at a much richer space of types, the mathematical types.  However, since this is only an approximation, it fails in ways that may be unpredictable in real applications.  And we are limited in what we can approximate by the specific hardware and software available to us as scientists.  \n",

    "Fortunately, the human mind has no such limitation.  We are able to see passed the finite and consider the infinite.  As stated in previous sections, there are problems that machines simply cannot solve, because they can only approximate the infinite.  Here we introduce a rich set of infinite types which will aid us in coming up with algorithms which we will use to approximate results through the computables.  These types will be:\n",

    "* The natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$\n",

    "The natural numbers can be thought of as the counting numbers, starting at 0 and heading to infinity one at a time.  So the sequence starts off as:\n",
    "\n",
    "0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "* The integers $\\mathbb{Z}$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* The rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rational numbers are ratios of integers in lowest terms.  So all the integers are a subset of the rationals if you consider the rational equivalent to be an integer over one like:\n",

    "* The irrational numbers $\\mathbb{P}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as there are rational numbers that cannot be represented as integers, there are numbers that cannot be expressed as ratios in lowest terms, and yet they are numbers.  An example of this is $\\sqrt{2}$.  While clearly a number, and one that comes up _often_.  It is not rational.  We will see a proof of this fact later on in the chapter and prove it's generalization.\n",

Those are numbers that we cannot even approximate with finite representations of numbers.  For instance, $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, so we cannot write down an 'exact' numeric representation, but we can at least write down $\\sqrt{2}$.  But with the transcendentals, like $\\pi$ or $e$ we cannot even do that.  There are formulas that approximate both and they do so very, very well.

This leads to a standard structure for each proof, based on type, dependent on the property or statement of inquiry.

    "## Proofs in the Irrationals\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there isn't a lot of 'new' stuff in the basic properties of the rationals.  However, there are certainly interesting proofs here.  One of the classic proofs involves the irrationality of the $\\sqrt{2}$.  This proof poses a major digression from the proofs we've seen before.  If you are reading this book, you've liked used the consequences of this theorem for a very long time, for instance, if you've ever taken calculus.  But it is worth to take a moment and realize that the irrationality of $\\sqrt{2}$ was once _hottly debated_.  This is because this irrational number comes up _naturally_ in a lot of the mathematics that has been known since the days of Pythagoras.  Consider the Pythagorian formula for distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "First recall the general distance formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c = \\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now set a = b = 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{1^{2} + 1^{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many who insisted that $\\sqrt{2}$ must be measurable in a precise way, and that this quantity was therefore rational.  And yet, an exact mathematical number alluded scholars until this proof was discovered.  The acceptance of the irrational numbers was a breakthrough in mathematics.  Without the irrationals, we would not have had the calculus in it's current form.  And that may have meant countless scientific and engineering discoveries never occur.  This proof is a forebarer for much of the innovation over the course of human history.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, the irrationality of the square root of 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem: The square root of two is irrational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by assuming to the contrary that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational.  Thus we can express it as $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{m}{n}$ such that m, n $\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and m,n are in lowest terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{m}{n} \\iff \\sqrt{2}^{2} = (\\frac{m}{n})^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2 = \\frac{m^{2}}{n^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2*n^{2} = m^{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $m^{2}$ is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "if $a^{2}$ even then a is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "We prove the contrapositive:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a is odd, then $a^{2}$ is odd:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 2k + 1, k $\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^{2} = (2k+1)(2k+1) = 4k^{2} + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^{2} + 2k) + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "by k $\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, 2(2k^{2} + 2k) + 1 is odd.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.E.D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our proof, by the above lemma we have m even by $m^{2}$ even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus m = 2q.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we have,\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n^{2} = 2q^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus $n^{2}$ is even and by the above lemma, therefore n is even.  This implies that both,\n",
    "\n",
    "m and n are even.  Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{m}{n} = {2q}{2p} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this is a contradiction because we assumed that $\\frac{m}{n}$ were a fraction in _lowest terms_.  That is, they have no common factors.  Therefore we always can find a term to divide out, forever.  There is no possible lowest terms ratio.  And since we cannot express the number $\\sqrt{2}$ as a ratio of two integers, it is not rational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.E.D.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that any number for the form $\\sqrt{p}$ where p is prime will be irrational.  Therefore there are _infinitely_ many irrational numbers.  You may be tempted at this point to think that there are fewer irrational numbers than rational ones.  But the reverse happens to be true.  There is an _initially_ sparser set of irrationals, however, we can also do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ab + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a, c $\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and b $\\in \\mathbb{P}$.  Thus we can take _combinations_ of rational numbers together with an irrational number.  Of course, the above construction is just the simplest one.  We can have _n_ many terms that are irrational.  Thus the _size_ of the irrational numbers is much larger than the size of the rationals.  In fact, there is a _countable_ infinity of rational numbers but an _uncountable_ infinity of irrational numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, countability is general benchmark of cardinality within infinite sets.  If a set is infinite but countable then there is a bijection to the natural numbers.  However, if the cardinality is uncountable no such bijection exists.  The irrationals is the first set we are discussing for which this is the case.  To some extent this is a watershed moment.  Here we leave the familiar primitive notions of counting that have guided mankind in it's infancy.  Now we tread on new ground, in a land beyond the comfortable, where intuition can and will often fail.  In this new land, mathematical objects will need to be treated with care and assumptions will have to be checked and studied carefully.  Here there be dragons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proofs in the Reals\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've gone through the irrationals, next we are ready to talk about the real numbers.  Alas, we cannot yet engage in a discussion regarding how to come up with formulas for transcendental numbers, so we'll have to take them as a given in the set of reals, $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall begin by looking at some straight forward proofs involving the reals, to get a flavor for how to prove things when real numbers are involved.\n",

Specifically, logarithms exhibit _asymptotic_ behavior, that is, eventually _they stop growing_.  Thus we can observe that there is an upper bound how to long it will take a certain algorithm to run, up to a constant factor based partially on hardware constraints, _regardless of input size_.  \n",

    "Induction works because of a property called well ordering.  \n",

    "If a set is well ordered then every nonempty subset has a least element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of subsets of the real numbers that are well ordered include:\n",

    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ be least elements of A.  Since $m_{1}$ is a least element, $m_{2} \\ge m_{1}$; while since $m_{2}$ is a least element, $m_{1} \\ge m_{2}$.  Therefore, $m_{1} = m_{2}$.\n",

    "We need only show that every nonempty subset of $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$ has a least element.  So let S be a nonempty subset of $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$.  If S is a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$, then, by the well ordering principal, S has a least element.  Hence we may assume that S is not a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$.  Thus S - $\\mathbb{N}$ is a finite nonempty set and so contains a least element t.  Since $t \\le 0$, it follows that $t \\le x$ for all $x \\in S$; so t is a least element of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$ is well ordered will be of paramount importance as we will see in the next proof:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and let S be a subset of $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$ such that\n",

    "* $m \\in S$; and\n",
    "* whenever $k \\in S$, then $k + 1 \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then S = $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",

    "Assume, to the contrary, that \n",

    "$$S \\ne \\mathbb{N}_{m}$$.  \n",
    "\n",

    "$$S \\subset \\mathbb{N}_{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Define,\n",

    "$$ T = \\mathbb{N}_{m} - S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T \\ne \\emptyset$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$ is partitioned into S and T.  Since T is a nonempty subset of $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$, and $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$ is well ordered, T has a least element $t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since $x \\ge m$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{N}_{m}$ and $m \\in S$, it follows that $t > m$;\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t - 1 \\ge m$$ \n",

    "Since t is the smallest element of T, \n",

    "\n",
    "Q.E.D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we cannot partition $\\mathbb{N}_{m}$ into two subsets, therefore if there exists some base case (the first property) and if whenever k is in the set, then k+1 is in the set, then the _whole_ set 'greater than' that base case will be in the same set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This property would not be possible without the well ordering principal - which states there is a smallest element for the subset.  Recall that sets, relations and functions can all be thought of the same way.  This notion of a smallest element means there is a smallest element for which rules can be true.  Which is at the heart of proof by induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other major component is the notion of increase - by showing that a given kth element and the k+1st element are both in the set, then all the larger elements are also.  This property is surprising and often hard to digest for those new to the subject.\n",

    "The above proof does illustrate why - we cannot construct a set that bounds S above, assuming properties one and two hold.  The inability to bound S above is _why_ induction works.\n",
