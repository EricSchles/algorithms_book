    "# Introduction To Proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section we learned Python.  Next we will cover proofs, which will be a complete change of gears.  Then in the next section, introduction to counter examples, we will make a first attempt at combining programming and proofs.\n",

    "## What Is Mathematics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's likely if you are reading this book you've studied mathematics before, potentially for a large part of your life, have you ever considered what mathematics is?  Take a moment to think about what mathematics means to you.  If you can, write down a definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've thought about it for a few minutes, and come up with your own definition, let's consider some possible definitions that I thought about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is mathematics the study of counting?  Certainly, mathematics started off about counting, and we can think of lots of ways to build from the counting to lots of other things.  But if all we interested in was counting, then things like geometry might be hard to think about.  So, I think we have to reject that as the definition.  Although, counting is certainly a _part_ of mathematics.  It's so important it's got it's own name, combinatorics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is mathematics the study of numbers?  Mathematics definitely involves numbers.  But again we run into the problem with geometry still?  We can think of numbers as a natural extension of counting for a while, but at some point we reach numbers like $\\sqrt{2}$ which doesn't have an intuitive counting equivalent.  But this is a natural thing to do in geometry.\n",

    "It is not easy to count $\\sqrt{2}$ and yet, it is a thing that occurs _very_ naturally.  So numbers cannot entirely be based on counting.  And even then, it's still not entirely obvious how to capture shapes in the numbers.  Of course, if we embed shapes in the cartesian plane, then this becomes clear, like we did above.  But what if we want to consider geometry _outside_ of the plane?  What then?\n",

In case you've never seen the above topics before:\n",

    "The study of complex numbers is called complex analysis.  The study of spaces is called linear algebra, when we are dealing with translations between cartesian coordinates.  If we are dealing with discrete graphs, we are studying graph theory.  The study of spaces when we are not dealing with translations between cartesian coordinates is called topology.  There are many more fields of mathematics, like probability theory, category theory, homology, abstract algebra, real analysis, calculus, differential equations, and many more.  Each discipline is a _part_ of mathematics, but not all of it.  \n",

    "Mathematics is the study of falsifiable statements, and primarily concerned with coming up with _new_ true and false statements using a combination of logic, previously proven mathematical statements, and experimental evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to learn mathematics, we need to know the _definitions_ of our subfield, we need to know logic, and we need to be able to check our logic for errors or counter examples.  If we can do all that, then we can do mathematics in _any_ subfield, no matter how sophisticated or simple.  Notice, that our definition requires that any statement we consider to prove mathematically be such that, it be either true or false, but not both.  This becomes very tricky in some parts of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we consider probability, statistics, or machine learning, it's _not_ necessarily the case that any of the things we say or try to provide evidence for will _stay_ true.  This is where mathematics and science diverge.  Science necessarily has to allow for exceptional cases.  The hypotheses science attempts to prove necessarily have falsifiability.  But that doesn't mean that those statements _always_ be true.  Just that they be predictable.  There are millions of reasons a given experiment could fail, and that may or may not mean that the hypothesis under consideration is true or false.  That is because there is a component of experimental design, associated with an experiment.  And experimental design is subject to failures outside of the thing under observation.  One of these factors is, humans.  We define the parameters of our experiments, and that doesn't always mean we define them correctly.  We also have to analyze the data _after_ or _during_ the experiment has been carried out.  And often when that happens, there can be errors.  This implies that science is certainly interested in truth, but does not require the same tools, nor can we necessarily draw the same conclusions from mathematics that we can from science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that both aren't _important_ and that they can't work together - they absolutely can and do.  It is my ascertion that both are requirements for the other.  Science helps grounds mathematics in usefulness, and mathematics allows us to extend the technical capabilities of all science.  Therefore, when done well, and learned seriously, the two skills naturally reinforce one another.  But too much of one and not the other can lead to cellings in how far you can go.  \n",

    "One of the important differences between sets in Python and mathematical sets is, Python sets are _always_ finite.  We have no such restriction in mathematics.  And in fact, _most_ of the sets we'll study are infinite.  The 'smallest' infinite set we'll typically look at is the natural numbers, that is the set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{N} = [0,1,2,3,4...]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $\\mathbb{N}$ starts with $0$.  Not all mathematicians believe this to be the case.  So, it's important to check.  Most computer scientists start the $\\mathbb{N}$ with 0, which is why we adopt this convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we get into the typical stuff, let's start with some primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set theory is about _membership_.  By understand what elements are in a set and what elements are outside a set, then we can prove things about the set.  In Python the equivalence here is the `in` operator.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The proofs we will look at, will start by selecting a single \"representative\" element from a given set, and show how that element is contained or not contained in another set.  By doing so, the relationship between two sets will be understood.\n",

    "In this case A $\\cap$ B = B.  If that's the case then we write B $\\subseteq$ A, for B is a subset of A.\n",

    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this proof we have a few cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A $\\cap$ B = $\\emptyset$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\emptyset$ is a short hand for the empty set, and means the set with no elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A $\\cap$ B $\\ne$ $\\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the intersection contains at least 1 element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do case 2 first, since it's more typical:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that A $\\cap$ B $\\ne$ $\\emptyset$.  Thus let us define x such that x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B.  The $\\in$ operator indicates that our element is a _member_ of some set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B (by assumption)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore x $\\in$ A and x $\\in$ B.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here there are a couple of cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A $\\subseteq$ B\n",
    "2. B $\\subseteq$ A\n",
    "3. some of the elements of A and B overlap, but not all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are in case 3 then, the following picture is a good depiction:"

    "In this case, then we can see x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B, here labeled '5'.  We can also see clearly from the picture that the 'or' operator subsumes the 'and' operator.  In particular if x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B, then it is in A and B, which doesn't include the elements in the union of the form A - B or B - A.  Therefore, we can state:\n",

    "if x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B => x $\\in$ A $\\cup$ B, but x $\\notin$ A - B and x $\\notin$ B - A.\n",

Note, that the above logic assumes that, by definition of B $\\subseteq$ A, all the elements in B are also in A, but the reverse is not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we consider case 1, A $\\subseteq$ B:\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we assume x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B, but now we also know A $\\subseteq$ B, so we have:\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, let us consider the case where A $\\cap$ B = $\\emptyset$.\n",

    "In this case, there are no elements x $\\in$ A $\\cap$ B, therefore the proof is vaccuously true by \n",
    "\n",
    "False => True is True and False => False is True.  So there are no cases, where the proof false.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, since the element x was non-specific, we can apply all of the steps above to any element of the sets.  Therefore it is true for all the elements of the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things we observed in this proof is:\n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\cup$ B = (A $\\cap$ B) $\\cup$ (A - B) $\\cup$ (B - A).  While we have verified this by the venn diagram picture above, sometimes it is useful to simply restate.  This will end up being a very useful fact for many proofs.  It allows us to directly show certain cases without having to consider a representative element.\n",

    "Next let's look at the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "For every two sets A and B,\n",
    "\n",
    "A - B = A $\\cap$ $\\bar{B}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\bar{B}$ means the set of all the elements not in B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we show that A - B $\\subseteq$ A $\\cap$ $\\bar{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let x $\\in$ A - B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then x $\\in$ A and x $\\notin$ B.  Since x $\\notin$ B, it follows that x $\\in$ $\\bar{B}$.  \n",

    "What does the relation look like, when the sets on the x and y axis change?  That idea is left to the reader to think about.  But know this, there is an answer.  And it can lead to more surprising and interesting notions than perhaps many would believe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close out this section we conclude with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose R is a relation such that, a R b and a $\\in$ A, b $\\in$ B.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each element in A, characterized here by a, there are four possible cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a is related to all the elements b $\\in$ B.\n",
    "2. a is related to some of the elements b $\\in$ B.\n",
    "3. a is related to one of the elements b $\\in$ B.  That is there is a unique b $\\in$ B such that a R b.\n",
    "4. a is related to _non_ of the elements b $\\in$ B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the extreme cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a is related to none of the elements in B, then R is $\\emptyset$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a is related to all of the elements in B, then R is A x B, in other words, R is the cartesian product that we saw at the beginning of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we consider case 3.  If a is related to exactly one of the elements b $\\in$ B, then R is a _function_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a formal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let A and B be nonempty sets.  By a function f from A to B, written $f: A \\rightarrow B$, we mean a relation from A to B with the property that every element a $\\in$ A is the first coordinate of exactly one ordered pair in $f$.  Since $f$ is a relation, the set A in this case is the domain of $f$.  The set B is called the codomain of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a function $f: A \\rightarrow B$, let (a,b) $\\in$ $f$, if (a,c) also $\\in$ $f$ then b=c.  An example here might help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let A = $\\mathbb{R}$, B = $\\mathbb{R}$, and let $f$= $x^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then what is $f(5)=$?  Well it's 25.  Are there any _other_ valid answers for $f(5)$?  In other words, can we plug in 5 to the parameter of our function and _ever_ expect a different answer?  Nope.  That's what it means for something to be a function!  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the case of dealing with a function, we can say:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f$ is a function, $f(a)=b$, and $f(a)=c$ then b = c.  In fact, it _must_ by definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepping backward for a second, suppose we asked the same question of a relation, could we find a relation such that some element a maps to possibly more than one place?  Well, yes!  Let's define one right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = \\{ (a,a), (a,b) \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a valid relation (in fact it was one of our previous examples.  And it takes a to not one but _two_ places.  Can we think of any typical relations such that this is works?  An obvious example is: `<=`.  Let's look at an example in Python:"

    "What do you see when you look at the graph?  Well one thing that might stand out is that negative and positive versions of _any_ number go to the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is for, $f(x) = x^{2}$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(a) = f(-a)$, $\\forall a$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, the $\\forall$ is read _for all_.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in particular that means $f(5) = f(-5)$ and so on.  And _any_ function like this, is a _valid_ function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that some functions have this looseness, we can specify properties such that our functions map elements to one and _only_ one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Injective - A function $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is called injective if every two distinct elements of A have distinct images in B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x) = 3x - 5$.  Then $f$ is injective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that $f(a) = f(b)$, where $a$,$b$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{R}$.  Then,\n",

    "$3a - 5 = 3b - 5$.  \n",

    "So f is injective.\n",
    "\n",
    "QED\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we started off by assuming that our elements in our codomain were equal.  If they produced distinct elements in our domain, in otherwords if our preimage mapped to different places, then we wouldn't have an injective function.  That's _why_ we 'undid' the operations of the function $f(x) = 3x - 5$ to both sides.  We _applied_ the preimage to the function.  Otherwise known as the inverse of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with proofs of injectivity we always go backwards, this is because, since we are dealing with a function, we already know that mapping from the domain to the image will guarantee uniqueness.  It's the going backwards, the inverse, that we aren't sure about.  So that's what we need to prove, in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Surjective - A function $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is called surjective if every element of B is the image of some element of A.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, functions can _miss_ part of the codomain.  We saw this when we looked at the graph of $f(x) = x^{2}$.  In specific, any number less than 0 doesn't show up in the codomain.  So that function is _not_ surjective.  Now let's prove that a certain function is surjective.\n",

    "Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x) = 3x - 5$.  Then $f$ is surjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $r$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{R}$.  We show that there exists $x$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = r$.  We can 'construct' our x to equal r by first applying the _inverse_ of $f(y) = 3y - 5$, namely $g(y) = \\frac{y + 5}{3}$ to x.  Note: we _do not_ claim that the inverse g is an actualy function, merely that it reverses the mechanical operations of the function f.  For right now, we only claim that g is a rule for reversing $f$.  Moving on, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = g(r) = \\frac{r + 5}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = f(\\frac{r + 5}{3}) = 3(\\frac{r + 5}{3}) - 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r + 5 - 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we could find an x that produces r and because x and r were _generic_ elements of $\\mathbb{R}$ this means $\\forall$ elements this is true.  Therefore _every_ element in our codomain has a corresponding element in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bijective - A function $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is called bijective if every element of B is the image of some element of A and if every two distinct elements of A have distinct images in B.  In other words, if $f$ is injective and surjective, it is bijective.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bijective function just means that's it's inverse is _also_ a function.  Let's look at a counterexample first:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the function $f(x) = x^{2}$, is it's inverse also a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can show it's not by considering it's preimage and looking at some specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "(5, 25), (-5, 25).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly,  $(5, 25), (-5, 25) \\in f$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So to get the _preimage_ of $f$ we simply need to reverse the order of our coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have $f^{-1}$ (said as f inverse) with elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(25, 5), (25, -5) \\in f^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we have 25 -> 5 AND 25 -> -5.  So $f^{-1}$ is _definitely not_ a function.  In fact, we could have said:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (a, a^{2}), (-a, a^{2}) \\in f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then looked at the inverse, $f^{-1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(a^{2}, a), (a^{2}, -a) \\in f^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are _infinitely_ many counterexamples of $f$ failing to be bijective.  "
